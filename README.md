# MultiMMNet: Multi Model Structure-Agnostic Framework for Enhanced Materials Discovery in Engineering Informatics

Multi-Model Material Network (MultiMMNet) is a structure-agnostic deep learning framework designed to accurately predict material properties using only compositional information. The architecture integrates five key components: a Transformer to capture global contextual relationships, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for local pattern extraction, a Pairwise Interaction module to model element-to-element relationships, a Cross Attention mechanism to align and fuse feature representations, and a Gated Linear Unit with Attention Network (GLUAN) for nonlinear feature modulation and interpretability. Together, these modules enable MultiMMNet to learn complex inter-element interactions and adaptively assign importance to elements within a composition. Evaluated on benchmark datasets, the model outperforms existing methods and sets new state-of-the-art performance in structure-agnostic materials property prediction.
