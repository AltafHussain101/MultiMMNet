# MultiMMNet: Multi Model Structure-Agnostic Framework for Enhanced Materials Discovery in Engineering Informatics

MultiMMNet is a deep learning framework for predicting material properties using only compositional information. By combining a dual-encoder architecture (Transformer + CNN) with a gated attention mechanism and advanced fractional encoding, MultiMMNet enables accurate, interpretable, and structure-agnostic materials property prediction—making it especially useful for early-stage discovery and dopant-sensitive systems.
